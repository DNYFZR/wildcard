<h1 align="center"> 🃏 Wildcard 🃏 </h1>

Just random dev notes...

**To do**

- Add check for A2345 straights
- Add scoring for matched hands e.g. AAA88 vs QQQKK -> [14,14,14,8,8] vs [12,12,12,13,13] -> 14 vs 12 & 8 vs 13 -> first hand has higher triplet etc. 
- Tidy up - could build classes, also could pool common functionality in separate script and import to blackjack / poker ???
