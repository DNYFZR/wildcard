<h1 align="center"> 🃏 Wildcard 🃏 </h1>

This is a playing card games app, blackjack only atm, and has been developed using TS / React.

The app uses the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) to initialise a 10 deck stack of cards, and then to shuffle and draw from the stack.  

The dealer is set a minimum card total of 18, which is triggered once the player decides to stick.

There are many improvements that can / may be made to how the current code is configured (I did write the first version in a few hours 💙).

The app is deployed on my [Github Pages](https://dnyfzr.github.io/wildcard/)... if you fancy a game or two... 🃏
